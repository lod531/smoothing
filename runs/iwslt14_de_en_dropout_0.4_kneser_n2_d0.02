2022-03-15 21:54:56 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: and i arrange them. and, you know, it's also slightly different, because an architect, in comparison to the outside world, say, a dance group is ultimately an investigation between your private world, the worlds of your own concepts, the ideas, the peaks, the creators, with the relationship to the outside world and all the constraints, the ones.
2022-03-15 21:54:56 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: and i organize it. and, well, it's also a bit different because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations, of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations, the naysayers.
2022-03-15 21:54:57 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: and hopefully you're also in this idea that engineers and designers are using all these different climate parameters so that it's going to be possible to create really good and comfortable air conditions to change our thermal perception so that we feel comfortable in an outdoor space. we're going to do that with the best passive design, but also by using the energy source of the site in cat, the sun.

2022-03-15 21:55:01 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: th: one of the reasons that makes it very interesting and appropriate for me here at tedwomen is because -- well, at the striking dinner, it was best summarized when someone said, "turn to men on your table and say to them, 'when the revolution starts supporting you.'" the truth, love women is that we've already started supporting you with this issue for a long time, with rachel carson paulo's "to downstream our sandbanks."

2022-03-15 21:55:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: now luckily, the mother of invention is still the mother of invention, and a large part of the design work that we're on our airplane on was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were linked to operating on the ground -- everything from a continuously variable system, and a coolness system that allows us to use an aircraft in the go-go-to-go-traffic machine to a particular pigeon drive, either when you see the propelled pigeon tracks or when you get rid of a mechanism, to the ground, when you see the mechanics that allows us to go down to the ground.
2022-03-15 21:55:03 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
