'"rael carlanson," then, "then, you turn down our stumber's future to sandstone stream."

2022-03-15 22:32:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: fortunately, the mother of invention is still the mother of invention, and a large part of the design work that we're on our plane at the furniture was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to doing it on the ground -- everything, from a continuously variable table and a cooling system with refrigeration that allows us to use an aircraft in the stop-go-go-traffic to a particularly appropriate drive that either drives the propellers, or when you're flying down to the ground, when you're in the same case that mechanism, until you're in the same case, to see the aircraft.
2022-03-15 22:32:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
