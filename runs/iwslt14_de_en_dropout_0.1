2022-03-14 08:14:27 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: we put the beeper in the clinic.
2022-03-14 08:14:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: that's the doha skyline, which i think most people know here.
2022-03-14 08:14:31 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha.
2022-03-14 08:14:34 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: stars will make new goldilocks conditions that will create these two new voirs.
2022-03-14 08:14:34 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds.
2022-03-14 08:14:38 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: for example, there's french chinese food, where frog with salt and pepper is served.

2022-03-14 08:14:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: it's clear that we don't just bring some electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.
2022-03-14 08:14:42 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.
2022-03-14 08:14:47 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: and in the measures of how people took responsibility to the wildlife, the number of wildlife grew back. and that's a basis for conservation in namibia.
2022-03-14 08:14:47 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: and thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife, wildlife numbers started coming back, and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia.
2022-03-14 08:14:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: first, some of the strands of magnetic field are trapped inside, but the superconductor doesn't like it if they move, because their movements use, and so the superconductors.
2022-03-14 08:14:51 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside, but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around, because their movements dissipate energy, which breaks the superconductivity state.
2022-03-14 08:14:55 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: so if we take advantage of the information that comes from this reflection, we can start with a traditional facial can that will resemble the larger configurations of the face and add the basic shape, and refuse it through that single information that includes the entire portion structure and all the floods.
2022-03-14 08:14:55 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: so, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.
2022-03-14 08:15:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: th: one of the reasons it's interesting, and it's measurable to be here at tedwomen, is that -- well, when it's strided dinner it was best known as somebody said, "turn on men on your desk and say to you, 'if the revolution begins, we will support you.'"

2022-03-14 08:15:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: th: one of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that, well, i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'when the revolution starts, we've got your back.'" the truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with rachel carson's "silent spring" to theo colborn's "our stolen future" to sandra steingraber's books "living downstream" and "having faith."
2022-03-14 08:15:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: luckily, the mother of invention is still the mother of invention, and a big part of the design work that we're on our airplane on the proud zealand was a result that we had to solve the unique problems associated with the ground -- all of a continuous variables, and a system of refrigeration, and that allows us to use a refrigeration of the aircraft system, and that allows us to use to stop the reliance of one of the forces and a pipeline, and the propelled to the aircraft system if you can be reliance, or if you can see on the propelled to the aircraft.
2022-03-14 08:15:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
