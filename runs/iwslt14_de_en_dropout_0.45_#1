2022-03-22 20:21:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: th: one of the reasons why it makes it very interesting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is because, well, at the arguing dinner, it was best summarized when somebody said, "turn to men on your desk and tell them, 'when the revolution begins,' we're supporting you. '" the truth, love women is we've been supporting you on this topic for a long time with rachel carly, "and then," carly, "and then our" proud coke's future to downstream, "and downstream."
2022-03-22 20:21:00 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: th: one of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that, well, i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'when the revolution starts, we've got your back.'" the truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with rachel carson's "silent spring" to theo colborn's "our stolen future" to sandra steingraber's books "living downstream" and "having faith."
2022-03-22 20:21:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: fortunately, the mother of invention is still the mother of invention, and a large part of the design work that we're on at our aircraft was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to operate on the ground -- everything from a continuously variable variable system and a cooling system with liquid that allows us to use an aircraft in stop-go-traffic to a particular passenger that either drives the propeller or if you're in the ground, to be able to be able to see the wrong for a security facility.
2022-03-22 20:21:02 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
