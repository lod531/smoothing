2022-03-15 12:11:09 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: luckily, the mother of invention is still the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're most proud of on our plane was a result of the fact that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to operating on the ground -- everything from a continuously variables to a refrigerator system that allows us to use an aircraft machine in stop-and go-traffic to a specially appropriate vehicle that either drives propeller, or if you're flying on the ground, to see the wrong mechanism, the same thing that we're going to be able to be able to do in a storm.
