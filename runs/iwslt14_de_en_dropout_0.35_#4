2022-03-22 19:48:22 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: luckily, the mother of invention is still, and a large part of the design work that we're most proud of at our airplane was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to operate on the ground -- everything from a continuously variable operating and cooling system that allows us to use an airplane at stop-and-go traffic, until a particular appropriate vehicle that drives the propelled propellant on the ground, or if you're on the floor, you're going to see the mechanism, if you're going to see the misconception of a mechanism.
2022-03-22 19:48:22 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
