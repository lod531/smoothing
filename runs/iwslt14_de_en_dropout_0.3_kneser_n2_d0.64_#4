2022-03-24 01:26:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: first of all, some strands of magnetic field are caught inside, but the superconductor doesn't like it if they move, because their movements are using energy, and so the superconductive cold.
2022-03-24 01:26:11 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside, but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around, because their movements dissipate energy, which breaks the superconductivity state.
2022-03-24 01:26:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: so if we use the information that comes from this mirror reflection, we can start with a traditional facial can, which reads the big contextures of the face and the basic shape, and through the dieft of that information that refers the entire por-structure and all the fa folding.
2022-03-24 01:26:17 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: so, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.

2022-03-24 01:26:24 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: th: one of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that, well, i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'when the revolution starts, we've got your back.'" the truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with rachel carson's "silent spring" to theo colborn's "our stolen future" to sandra steingraber's books "living downstream" and "having faith."
2022-03-24 01:26:26 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: , luckily, the mother of invention, and a big part of the design work that we're on on our plane is stumbling was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously varied propulsion and a cooling system with fluid that allows us to use an aircraft machine in stopand goand, until a specific passage, which is either to operate, if you're on the ground, or if you're moving the wings to the ground or you're on the ground -- everything, if you're at the same time, you're going to see the wings, to the ground.
2022-03-24 01:26:26 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
