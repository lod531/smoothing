2022-03-23 13:12:04 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: so, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.

'"the truth, women, we've been supporting you in this topic for a long time.
2022-03-23 13:12:08 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: th: one of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that, well, i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said, "turn to the man at your table and tell them, 'when the revolution starts, we've got your back.'" the truth is, women, you've had our back on this issue for a very long time, starting with rachel carson's "silent spring" to theo colborn's "our stolen future" to sandra steingraber's books "living downstream" and "having faith."
2022-03-23 13:12:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: luckily, the mother of invention is necessary, and a large part of the design work that we're on our airplane on stumbling, was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to doing it on the ground -- everything from a continuously variable drive and a refrigeration system that allows us to use a aircraft in stop and traffic to a special drive that either drives the unique propellant or if you're flying at the ground, to see the ground, to the mechanism until you're going to the mechanism, to the security.
2022-03-23 13:12:10 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
